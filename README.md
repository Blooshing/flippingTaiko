# flippingTaiko
- A simple script that flips every kat and don in the .osu. This does not change anything but the colors that are present in the WHOLE map.

# How it works
- It flips the 0 and 8 inside the fifth column of the .osu under the [HitObjects] category. This simple just means that your dons will become kats and kats will become dons.

# Why? 
- I needed a why to flip a difficulty's colors but not the patterns. This was a quick script that made it happen and is pretty reliable and safe.
